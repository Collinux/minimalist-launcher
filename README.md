  <b>Configurable, super lightweight app launcher with a low memory usage and small install size. Looks a little bit like Light Phone, but you still can run all apps on your device.</b></p>

### Free & Open Source
   There are no trackers, no ads, and no device permissions. There is only Open Source Code, available on GPLv2 license.
   
   It's a fork of https://github.com/Collinux/minimalist-launcher by Collunux. Created because there is no 'favourite' apps in the main repo.

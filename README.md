<p><b>Configurable, super lightweight app launcher with a low memory usage and small install size.</b></p>
<p>Inspired by Light Phone, but leaves you access to all apps, by just one swipe.</p>

### How to use
<p>Main screen allows you to use 5 configurable apps, just long press on `EMPTY` item, and choose your favourite app.</p>
<p>To go to the all-apps view, just swipe left. Long press on that view allows you to read info about app.</p>

### Free & Open Source
   There are no trackers, no ads, and no device permissions. There is only Open Source Code, available on GPLv2 license.
   
   It's a fork of https://github.com/Collinux/minimalist-launcher by Collunux. Created because there is no 'favourite' apps in the main repo.
   
### Code
   This is my first Android project, done for my purpose, so be gentle :)
